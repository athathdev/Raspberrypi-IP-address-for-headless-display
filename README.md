# Raspberrypi-IP-address-for-headless-display
This is a simple program that will display the IP address of the RaspberryPi on a OLED screen.

1) Initially, compile this program on your Pi when it is connected to a display. Keep the executable in a known location.

2) Next time, when you are using Pi in a headless way, connect a USB keyboard to the Pi and execute this file headlessly. The IP address will be displayed on the screen. Now, you can login using this address using ssh, vnc, etc.
